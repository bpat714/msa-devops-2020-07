React Web App for browsing Astronomy Picture of the Day 

## Getting started

### Dependencies 
- npm 
- node.js 
- react

### Executing Program 
- clone the repository the to run the program, go to my-app (cd my-app) then run (npm run start) should open up localhost:3000
- alternatively visit https://msa-2020-07.azurewebsites.net/ (note that the implementation is yet to be complete and therefore 
  the website is not able to fetch data using Nasa API due to hidden key ðŸ”‘. There is yet work to be done to resolve this issue)

### Description of Build and Release Pipeline
- To Build the Pipeline I have used a starter pipeline on Azure which contains a YAML file
- To ensure it also triggers when a commit is added to a branch called "develop" I've added develop under trigger stage
- Then a script is written to build and deloy the react app
- To do so it first goes into my-app then runs npm install then npm run build then return out of it
- then I have added build to archieve folder
- Then I published build folder to release and deploy the app 
- Then for the release pipeline I have taken the build artifacts from build pipeline and deloyed it
